# dewm
[Forked](https://github.com/rollcat/dewm)

`dewm` is a pure Go autotiling window manager. You may find it
somewhat similar to [dwm][] or [wmii][], but has some ideas of its
own.

This `dewm` was forked from Kamil (Rollcat)'s which in turn was forked from Dave MacFarlane's [dewm][original-dewm],
which was written in [literate style][literate-programming], using
[lmt][]. The fork dropped the original Markdown sources, heavy
refactoring and cleanup was done, bugs were fixed, some features
dropped, more added, arbitrary changes made.

## Goals
Based off of the dewm, this fork seeks to:

1. Be runnable on the mac via XQuartz
2. Provide multiple monitor support (pending) 
3. Provide multiple screens per monitor

## Basics

`dewm` is a very simple window manager that seeks to arranges winows on a screen automaticly freeing the user from the need to keep track of or position windows. Most users probobly never has experienced a window manager like this being use to needing to move and size windows manually. In fact, the current state of computing has resulted in most users having so many windows open on the screen that windows actually get lost.

Windows are arranged using three different layouts, Column, Focus, and Monical. 

* Column - All windows displayed in one vertical column
* Focus - Primary window taking most of the screen on the left with a column of other windows on the right.
* Monical - Stacks all the apps on top of one another with the primare window on top. All windows are full screen.

Keybindings then allow you to move windows around in layout specific ways.

## Keybindings

These keybindings are currently hardcoded, but may one day be configurable. Note, if running on Mac OS X, be sure to set the option key to act as an alt key in XQuarts preferences.

### Window Management

* `Alt-right/Alt-left/Alt-Up/Alt-Down` move the current window position.
* `Alt-N` create a new column 
* `Alt-D` delete any empty columns

### Layouts

* `Alt-c` - switch to column layout
* `Alt-f` - switch to focus layout
* `Alt-m` - switch to monical layout

### Other

* `Alt-Enter` spawn an xterm
* `Alt-Shift-Enter` spawn an st
* `Alt-Q` close the current window
* `Alt-Shift-Q` destroy the current window
* `Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Q` quit dewm

## Command Line Interface
If your keybindings clash or you just can't remember and use them, the command line interface can be used to issue all the same actions. These can also be used to script control of the window manager. The window manager listens to a [Named Pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe) for commands. Each command is on one line and if there are parameters it is separated by a `:`.

The Named Pipe will be in the tmp drive and has an extintion matching the x-windows display number. 

	echo left >> /tmp/dewm-commands.0

You can also use the window manager binary to send messages by using the `--command` flag. Here is an example of sending a command to dewm running on display :1 (not the default) which will send commands to `/tmp/dewm-commands.1`

	DISPLAY=:1 ; ./dewm --command 'tag:1'

Acceptable commands are in the table below.

| Command | Param  | Description
| ------- | ------ | ------------
|     add |        | Add a new column
|   clean |        | Clean up columns
|    quit |        | Try to quit nicely
|    exit |        | Forcfully stop program
|    term |        | Open a XTerm
|    open | app    | Open \<app\>
|   focus |        | Switch to the focus view
| monical |        | Switch to the monical view
|  column |        | Switch to th ecolumn view
|     tag | number | Push the top app to screen \<number\>
|    view | number | Switch to screen \<number\>
|    left |        | Move apps left
|    down |        | Move apps down
|      up |        | Move apps up
|   right |        | Move apps right



## Differences from fork

* Updated to support modern (1.17) golang specs (go.modâ€¦)
* Added Focus layout
* VIM arrow keys convented to actual arrow keys
	* Sorry, I'm a dvorak keyboard user, vim arrows are cool but do not actually help me
* Command Line Interface 
* Multiple workspace (planned)
	* may be working
* Multi Monitor support (planned)
	* Currently assumes one virtual monitor
